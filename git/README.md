# Git
Are you ready to take your collaborative coding the **next level**? As a **10x** developer _you know_ the pOwEr of a 1337 custom config. 

It's time to l3v3l up with these s1ck git configs, brah.

Different environments may require different user setup information (e.g. email, pgp key, names), so in this case, simply copy the `gitconfig` file to $HOME and edit as needed:

```bash
cp git/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```
