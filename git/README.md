# Git
Are you ready to take your collaborative coding the **next level**? 

It's time to l3v3l up with these s1ck git configs, brah.

Different environments may require different user setup information (e.g. email, pgp key, names), so in this case, simply copy the `gitconfig` file to $HOME and edit as needed:

```bash
cp git/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```
